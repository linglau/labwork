Opening lightbox contents from external URL

The problem is that I want to supply my client with a URL as so:

/page/#titleOfLightbox

And I want it to automatically open up the lightbox when users go to that URL.

This solution uses Javascript location.href to search the URL and begin the function on certain conditions.
