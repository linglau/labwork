Taking inspiration from Honda’s new speed-reading advert I thought I’d create a pure Javascript speed reader test.

It’s pretty simple in that it take how many words are in an element. Splits them into an array. The user submits a Words Per Minute speed and a calculation works out the milliseconds delay to display and remove the words on screen.
