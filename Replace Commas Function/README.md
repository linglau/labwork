Javascript - Function to replace all commas in a string

The problem: You have a string where you need to replace or remove a certain character inside it, for example a comma, or a forward slash. Using: $(this).replace(’,’,’‘) does not work as it only removes the first comma/forward slash.

This is a function to replace all commas in a string. We can use this function to format prices e.g. £123,000,222,111. Also we can use it for URLs and breaking apart each individual part of a URL into an array and then manipulating that in whatever way. A neat little function.
